  <li>If they wake up and start breathing, stay with them.</li>
  <li>Naloxone wears off in 30-90 minutes. When it does, the person could stop breathing again. Watch them until medical help arrives.</li>
  <li>Place the person into the recovery position (on their side) so they can breathe and so that they won't choke on any vomit.</li>
  <li>If you must leave, put the person in a place where they can easily be found.</li>
