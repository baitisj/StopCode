<H1>Encourage follow-up medical care</h1>

<p>
After treating an overdose with naloxone, the person can easily slip back into overdose and stop breathing again. Help the person get to the ER (or emergency personnel may take them). Health care staff will:
</p>

<ul>

<li>Relieve symptoms of withdrawal.</li>
<li>Monitor breathing and risks for another overdose.</li>
<li>Treat any other medical conditions.</li>

</ul>
